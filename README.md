# Yosemite

I examine the whether pyrodiversity enhances the resistance of
plant-pollinator communities and pollinator populations using a
variety of methods including 1) calculating metrics for describing
network topology 2) interaction turnover, 3) network role variability
and 4) extinction simulations. I am committed to reproducible science
and all analytical code will be maintained on github, along with a write up 
(in the writeup folder). 

The entire analysis is executable from the main.sh file (inside the analyseis folder).
All of the packages needed to run the analyses are listed in the packages.sh
file (located within the main directory). All R scripts were run in v3.5.3. 

Navigate to the analysisfolder within the github repo (Yosemite) then the main.sh file can be
selected and run in terminal. This will somewhat helpfully print the
results of each analysis and re-create any accompanying figures.

I walk through each the main script for each analysis
individually in the write up. There I also outline all of the decision points 
for each of the analysis.
